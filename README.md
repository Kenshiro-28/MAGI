# MAGI

MAGI is an autonomous agent leveraging the GPT model, providing streamlined and professional AI assistance for various tasks. Each time a query is made, MAGI decides autonomously whether to access the Internet for up-to-date information. Prime Directives allow you to customize the behavior of the model to suit your needs. Mission mode analyzes your query and generates an enhanced response based on a list of tasks that it automatically solves.

## Prime Directives

MAGI never forgets its Prime Directives. You can use popular prompts to enhance the behavior of the model. 

You can set your Prime Directives in the file **prime_directives.txt**. 

## Mission mode

MAGI features a Mission mode that analyzes your query and generates an enhanced response based on a list of tasks that it automatically solves. To enable Mission mode, type the letter **m** and press enter. The mission data will be saved in the file **mission.txt**.

## API key 

Save your OpenAI API key in an environment variable called **OPENAI_API_KEY**.

## Installation

- Clone this repository.

- Install Python 3.10 or later.

- Install Python packages:

```
$ pip install openai selenium bs4 webdriver_manager
```

## Running

Run this command in the root folder to start MAGI:

## Docker

I strongly recommend running MAGI inside a Docker container. This method significantly mitigates potential risks by isolating the application from the host system. Continue with the following steps to set up your Docker environment:

### Installation

You can install Docker from the official repositories of your Linux system:

```
$ sudo apt install docker.io
```

Create a Docker image with the OpenAI key:

```
$ sudo docker build --build-arg OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} --no-cache -t magi .
```

### Running

Run this command to start MAGI:

```
$ sudo docker run -it magi
```

Print the log of the last run:

```
$ sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps -l -q)
```
