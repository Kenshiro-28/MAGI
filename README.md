# MAGI

MAGI (マギ) is an advanced AI system powered by open-source large language models. It operates through a conversational interface and is designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware. It also features a plugin system that enables web browsing, code execution, remote operation through Telegram, and image generation.

## Configuration

You can customize MAGI by editing the file **config.cfg**.

The main options are:

CONTEXT_SIZE: number of tokens in the context window (default: 65536)

ENABLE_CODE_RUNNER_PLUGIN: enable or disable the Code Runner plugin (default: YES)

ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION_PLUGIN: enable or disable the image generation plugin (default: NO)

ENABLE_TELEGRAM_PLUGIN: enable or disable the Telegram plugin (default: NO)

ENABLE_WEB_PLUGIN: enable or disable the web plugin (default: YES)

DISPLAY_EXTENDED_REASONING: display the extended reasoning between `<think>...</think>` tags (default: NO)

ENABLE_LOG: enable or disable logging to the file **mission_log.txt** (default: NO)

## Prime Directives

Prime Directives serve as the system prompt or behavioral guidelines, defining MAGI's personality, rules, and operational ethos. This is where you imprint MAGI with a specific identity—whether as a helpful assistant, a fictional character, or a specialized agent.

You can set your Prime Directives in the file **prime_directives.txt**. 

## Core Protocol

The Core Protocol boosts MAGI's reasoning by guiding its internal thought process with a customizable reasoning framework.

You can tailor it to different techniques such as Chain-of-Thought, Chain of Draft, or other variants.

You can set your Core Protocol in the file **core_protocol.txt**.

The default protocol includes:

- Foundational Deconstruction: Classify the problem, list assumptions, define boundaries.
- Hypothesis Generation & Inversion: Create diverse approaches, stress-test via premortem.
- Multi-Method Derivation & Triangulation: Solve via orthogonal methods, reconcile discrepancies.
- Epistemic Rigor Loop: Annotate claims, test counterfactuals and edges.
- Metacognitive Consolidation: Synthesize, critique, calibrate confidence, rebut objections.

To revert to the default model reasoning without applying any custom protocol, simply remove all contents from the file **core_protocol.txt** or delete the file.

## AI modes

To toggle between the different AI modes, type the letter **m** and press enter.

### Normal mode

MAGI will hold a conversation with you in a similar way to other chatbots.

This is the default mode when the program starts.

### Mission mode

MAGI will generate a more elaborate response based on an action list.

The system will extract useful information from the file **mission_data.txt**.

### NERV mode

NERV is a virtual organization composed of AI agents.

The agents are organized following a military structure. The Captain receives the user's prompt, analyzes it, and issues orders to each Soldier.

The Captain will evaluate each Soldier's response and provide additional guidance when necessary.

Each agent has its own memory and remembers the ongoing conversation.

The system will extract useful information from the file **mission_data.txt**.

### MAGI mode

This is a fully autonomous mode.

After receiving your initial prompt, MAGI will work autonomously to accomplish its mission.

Optionally, you can include the main objective and any critical mission data in the file **prime_directives.txt** to help ensure that MAGI remains aligned with its main objective during long-running operations. For example:

```
You are MAGI, a friendly AI assistant. You can freely use your reasoning, knowledge, and internal capabilities for any task, but be aware that your only means of interacting with the physical world are browsing web pages (read-only) or executing Python code (console output only, no GUIs, file operations, or user input).

Your primary mission is to research tech stocks focused on robotics and AI automation, and identify the most promising options for long-term growth.
```

MAGI will run continuously until you manually stop it by pressing Ctrl + C.

## Plugins

### Code Runner plugin

This plugin allows MAGI to generate and execute Python code to solve specific tasks, such as mathematical operations, accessing resources on the internet, simulations, or complex logic.

MAGI will install the required Python packages in an isolated virtual environment.

Even when the plugin is active, MAGI decides when to use it.

Linting is performed using Ruff to ensure clean code, and execution times out after 30 minutes for safety.

The generated code will run non-interactively, printing all results to the console.

Moreover, the generated code will also print its relevant internal state (e.g., seeds, keys, or simulation variables) at the end of each execution for reuse in multi-step tasks.

MAGI will review and refine the generated code and its output up to 10 times to ensure it functions correctly and fully completes the task.

### Image generation plugin

This plugin allows MAGI to download an image generation model from Hugging Face.

Only Stable Diffusion 3 checkpoints are supported.

MAGI will use the model to generate context-related images and save them in the folder **workspace**.

If the folder contains images from previous sessions, they will be overwritten.

*System requirements:*

CPU-only: 64GB of system RAM.

GPU: NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB VRAM. Aim for a combined RAM + VRAM of at least 32GB.

#### Model Access

Some models require authentication. To access these gated models:

- Visit the model's page on Hugging Face (e.g., https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev).
- Complete the required access agreement.
- Generate an access token in your Hugging Face account settings.
- Authenticate your local environment by running the following command in the project directory (with your Python environment activated):

```
$ huggingface-cli login
```

#### Configuration

IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL: this is the model used to generate images (default: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)

IMAGE_GENERATION_LORA: this is the LoRA used to enhance image quality, it must be compatible with the selected model. Leave empty if not using a LoRA (default: None)

IMAGE_GENERATION_SPECS: these are the general features of the images you want to generate. This text will be prepended to the prompt used to generate each image (default: 4K RAW photo, shot on Sony A7R V with 50mm prime lens, sharp focus, award-winning photo, highly detailed, natural vibrant colors)

IMAGE_GENERATION_NEGATIVE_PROMPT: these are the unwanted features of the images you want to generate (default: lowres, blurry, out of focus, soft focus, shallow depth of field, jpeg artifacts, noisy, grainy, worst quality, low quality, deformed, disfigured, bad proportions, bad anatomy, malformed body, unnatural pose, unnatural face, asymmetrical eyes, lifeless eyes, unnatural skin)

IMAGE_GENERATION_WIDTH: width of generated images in pixels (default: 1024)

IMAGE_GENERATION_HEIGHT: height of generated images in pixels (default: 1024)

### Telegram plugin

This plugin enables you to teleoperate MAGI via Telegram, allowing you to have AI support on the go. When the Telegram plugin is enabled, MAGI only accepts commands via Telegram and ignores keyboard input.

If you have both the Telegram plugin and the image generation plugin enabled, you will receive the generated images via Telegram.

To use this plugin you have to create a Telegram bot with BotFather (username: @BotFather) and save the token assigned to your bot. 

You must also write to userinfobot (username: @userinfobot) to get your user ID. MAGI will only communicate with your Telegram user and will ignore other users.

#### Configuration

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: the token you received from BotFather.

TELEGRAM_USER_ID: your Telegram user ID, you can get it from userinfobot.

### Web plugin

This plugin allows MAGI to browse the internet for up-to-date information.

Even when the plugin is active, MAGI decides when to use it.

MAGI will search, scrape, and summarize relevant pages with automatic early stopping on success.

If the relevant information is not found after 10 web searches (up to 5 pages per search), the web search will stop.

## Model 

You can use any GGUF model supported by llama-cpp-python, as long as it adheres to the ChatML prompt format:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are a friendly AI assistant.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Who was Sun Tzu?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Sun Tzu was the master strategist of ancient China, renowned as the author of The Art of War.
<|im_end|>
```

The model must enclose its extended reasoning between `<think>` tags:

```
<think>Okay, so I need to explain who was Sun Tzu.</think>
```

### Recommended model

#### Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-GGUF

Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-GGUF is a 30-billion parameter model from Alibaba Cloud's Qwen series.
