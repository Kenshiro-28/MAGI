# MAGI

MAGI is an autonomous agent that leverages the Llama 2 model to offer an open-source AI accessible to everyone. MAGI is designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware and features a plugin system that enables Internet browsing and remote operation through Telegram.

## Prime Directives

You can set MAGI to behave like a fictional character or follow a set of rules. You just have to describe what you want and MAGI will follow your instructions.

You can set your Prime Directives in the file **prime_directives.txt**. 

## AI modes

To toggle between the different AI modes, type the letter **m** and press enter.

### Normal mode

MAGI will respond similarly to other chatbots, it will not save a log or browse the Internet. 

This is the default mode when the program starts.

### Mission mode

MAGI will generate a more elaborate response based on an action list and up-to-date information from the Internet.

It will save a log in the file **mission_log.txt**.

You can also add useful information in the file **mission_data.txt**.

### NERV mode

MAGI will autonomously plan and execute strategies to complete its goal, browsing the Internet for up-to-date information.

Once it receives a prompt, it will run continuously and accept no further prompts. To exit MAGI, press Ctrl + C.

It will save a log in the file **mission_log.txt**.

You can also add useful information in the file **mission_data.txt**.

## Plugins

You can configure MAGI plugins by editing the file **config.cfg**.

### Web plugin

This plugin allows MAGI to browse the Internet for up-to-date information.

#### Configuration

ENABLE_WEB_PLUGIN: enable or disable the web plugin (default: enabled).

### Telegram plugin

This plugin enables you to teleoperate MAGI via Telegram, allowing you to have AI support on the go. When the Telegram plugin is enabled, MAGI only accepts commands via Telegram and ignores keyboard input.

To use this plugin you have to create a Telegram bot with BotFather (username: @BotFather) and save the token assigned to your bot. 

You must also write to userinfobot (username: @userinfobot) to get your user ID. MAGI will only communicate with your Telegram user and will ignore other users.

#### Configuration

ENABLE_TELEGRAM_PLUGIN: enable or disable the Telegram plugin (default: disabled).

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: the token you received from BotFather.

TELEGRAM_USER_ID: your Telegram user ID, you can get it from userinfobot.

## Model 

You can use any Llama 2 model that is compatible with llama.cpp and has the following prompt format:

```
USER: Who was Sun Tzu? ASSISTANT: 
```

After cloning the repository, save the .bin file in the root folder. 

### Recommended model

At the time of writing, WizardLM-13B-V1.2 is the best Llama 2 model:

## Docker installation

I strongly recommend running MAGI inside a Docker container. This method significantly mitigates potential risks by isolating the application from the host system. 

### Prerequisites

#### Linux

- Install the following packages:

```
$ sudo apt install docker.io apparmor-utils
```

#### Other systems

- Install Docker

### Installation

- Clone this repository.

- Save a Llama 2 model in the root folder.

- Create a Docker image, you can do it by running this command in the root folder:

```
$ sudo docker build --no-cache -t magi .
```

### Running

Run this command to start MAGI:

```
$ sudo docker run -it magi
```

Print the log of the last run:

```
$ sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps -l -q)
```

To exit MAGI, type the command **exit** or press Ctrl + C.
