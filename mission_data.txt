The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
