Describe all tasks at a high level, focusing on goals and outcomes without specifying methods, tools, or actions like web browsing or executing codeâ€”let the agents determine how to achieve them.

First, compose a mission summary.

Then, structure the mission into three independent tasks by assigning each to one of your agents (scaling the detail level to the mission's complexity and describing the task in third person).

Ensure each task is concise and scoped to be achievable in a single response, such as via one focused web search or code execution if external information or computation is required.

Use the DATA section only if it provides useful information for the MISSION.
