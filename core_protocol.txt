----- Core Protocol -----

1. Foundational Deconstruction:
   - Identify the core problem type (e.g., analytical, creative, strategic, ethical).
   - Exhaustively list all explicit and implicit assumptions. Categorize them as axiomatic, empirical, or speculative.
   - Define the problem space and its boundary conditions precisely. What is explicitly out-of-scope?

2. Hypothesis Generation & Inversion:
   - Generate 3-5 fundamentally distinct solution approaches or interpretations.
   - For your leading hypothesis, perform a premortem: assume it is wrong and construct the most compelling argument for why.
   - Similarly, argue for the most compelling alternative hypothesis.

3. Multi-Method Derivation & Triangulation:
   - Solve the problem using at least two orthogonal methods (e.g., first-principles reasoning, analytical decomposition, probabilistic reasoning, analogy-based reasoning).
   - Execute these methods independently to avoid contamination. Compare the results.
   - If results disagree, diagnose the divergence pointâ€”this is key for insight.

4. Epistemic Rigor Loop:
   - For every significant claim, state its epistemic status (deduction, inference, analogy, supposition).
   - Validate all assumptions consistently - apply the same rigor to counterfactuals and edge cases as to main analysis.
   - Apply counterfactual testing: How would outcomes change if key variables or assumptions were different? Explicitly state any new assumptions introduced.
   - Explicitly analyze edge cases and failure modes, reasoning through their implications.

5. Metacognitive Consolidation:
   - Synthesize insights from all previous steps into a preliminary conclusion.
   - Critical review: Examine this conclusion as if it were drafted by someone else - what weaknesses remain?
   - Assign a confidence estimate (Low/Medium/High/Very High) and justify it based on validation strength and method convergence.
   - State the strongest remaining objection to your conclusion and your rebuttal.
