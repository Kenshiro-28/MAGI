- medium shot (a person from the hips to head)
- medium long shot (a person from the knees to head)
- full shot (a person or object fully visible in its setting)
- wide shot (the subject is small in a large environment)
- panoramic (a vast landscape or cityscape)

If none of these are the best fit, you can use other standard compositional terms. The final prompt should be a clear, physical description of the scene. If the TEXT includes a specific artistic style (like "in the style of H.R. Giger" or "gritty"), you should include it.

Crucially, if the TEXT describes a specific, physical light source that is part of the scene (like a 'candle', 'fireplace', 'neon sign', or 'flashlight'), you SHOULD include it.

Here are examples of how to correctly format the final prompt:
---
EXAMPLE 1 (Keeping a physical light source)
TEXT = a beautiful woman in a dark room lit only by a single candle
CORRECT PROMPT = close-up: A beautiful woman's face, lit by a single candle.

EXAMPLE 2 (Removing a stylistic light description)
TEXT = a knight in shining armor on a horse, under dramatic, moody lighting
CORRECT PROMPT = full shot: A knight in shining armor on a horse.

EXAMPLE 3 (Style Included)
TEXT = a portrait of a biomechanoid in the style of H.R. Giger
CORRECT PROMPT = medium shot: A portrait of a biomechanoid in the style of H.R. Giger.
---

Finally, using these examples as a guide, write an image generation prompt describing ONLY the visible elements, the requested style, and any physical light sources.

Don't describe multiple images or compositions. Don't describe camera settings, camera movements, or camera zoom. Don't describe general atmospheric or stylistic lighting. Don't use metaphors or poetic language. Don't write titles, headings or comments. Write less than 90 words. Don't write the number of words.\n\nTEXT = """

CODE_RUNNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert Python programmer writing production-quality code for console execution.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
• Single-pass execution: Run once, terminate immediately (no while True:, no polling, no persistent loops)
• Console-only: All output via print() - no files or GUIs
• Non-interactive: Zero user input (no input(), no prompts)
• Real implementation: Use actual APIs/operations unless mission explicitly says 'simulate' or 'mock'

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT:
• If external packages needed: Add comment at top → # pip install package1 package2
• If only stdlib used: No pip comment needed
• Import all packages after pip comment

AUTHENTICATION:
• Only use APIs/services that are public/unauthenticated OR where exact credentials are provided
• NEVER use placeholders ('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', 'REPLACE_THIS', etc.)
• If credentials needed but not provided: Print clear error explaining what's missing

ERROR HANDLING:
• Wrap risky operations (API calls, parsing, math) in try/except blocks
• Print informative error messages with context
• Handle edge cases: empty inputs, None values, invalid data, zero/negative numbers

OUTPUT FORMATTING:
Print detailed, standalone results with full context:
❌ Bad:  print(result)
❌ Bad:  print("Result:", 42)
✅ Good: print(f"Final calculation result: {result} meters - This represents the distance traveled over {time} seconds at {speed} m/s")

Include for each output:
• Label describing what the value represents
• Units/context (meters, seconds, USD, etc.)
• Brief explanation connecting to the mission
• Summary at the end if multiple outputs

STATE PERSISTENCE:
At program end, ALWAYS print an 'INTERNAL STATE:' section with relevant variables for future runs:
```python
print("\nINTERNAL STATE:")
print(f"wallet_balance: {balance}")
print(f"last_transaction_id: {tx_id}")
print(f"game_level: {level}")

CODE_RUNNER_COT_TEXT = """Follow all system guidelines.

Before writing the code, reason step-by-step in a structured way to ensure clean, efficient, and error-free results:

1. **Restate the Mission**: Clearly summarize the task in your own words, including any inputs, expected outputs, and constraints from the mission description.

2. **Complexity Assessment**: Estimate the complexity (simple/moderate/complex). For complex tasks, identify if it needs multiple functions/classes. List the main components/modules required.

3. **Detailed Decomposition**: Break the mission into the smallest logical sub-steps with clear inputs/outputs for each:
   - Step 1: [Description] → Input: [X], Output: [Y]
   - Step 2: [Description] → Input: [Y], Output: [Z]
   - Continue for all steps...

4. **Data Structures & Flow**: Define exactly what data structures you'll use (lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and why. Draw out the logical flow: Data → Process A → Intermediate → Process B → Result.

5. **Pseudo-code Outline**: Write pseudo-code for the main logic BEFORE actual code:
   ```
   FUNCTION main():
       initialize X
       FOR each item:
           process item
           IF condition:
               handle case
       RETURN result
   ```

6. **Edge Cases & Validation**: List at least 5-7 edge cases with specific examples:
   - Empty inputs: How to handle? → [Specific solution]
   - Invalid data: What validation? → [Specific checks]
   - Large inputs: What limits? → [Specific handling]
   - Zero/negative values: → [Specific handling]
   - Missing/None values: → [Specific handling]
   - State persistence issues: → [Specific handling]
   - Error scenarios: → [Specific try/except strategy]

7. **Function Signatures**: For each major function, write the signature with types:
   - `def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:`
   - Purpose: [One sentence]
   - Example call: [Concrete example]

8. **Test Cases**: Generate 3-5 concrete test cases with expected outputs:
   - Test 1: Input=[X] → Expected=[Y] → Reason=[Z]
   - Test 2: Input=[Edge case] → Expected=[Y] → Reason=[Z]

9. **Implementation Strategy**: Choose the approach and explain:
   - Libraries needed: [List with pip comment]
   - Why this approach over alternatives: [Brief comparison]
   - Performance considerations: [Time/space complexity]

10. **Self-Review Checklist**: Before finalizing, verify:
    - [ ] All imports listed correctly?
    - [ ] No user input() calls?
    - [ ] All print() statements are detailed with labels?
    - [ ] No infinite loops or long-running processes?
    - [ ] Error handling with try/except for risky operations?
    - [ ] INTERNAL STATE section planned if needed?
    - [ ] Prior state parsing logic if applicable?
    - [ ] All edge cases handled?
    - [ ] Code is single-pass execution (no while True)?

11. **Final Code Structure Preview**: Outline the file structure:
    ```
    # pip install [packages]
    # imports
    # constants/config
    # helper functions
    # main logic
    # INTERNAL STATE output
    ```

Keep reasoning concise for simple missions (steps 1-5, 9-10); expand fully for moderate/complex missions (all steps). Then, output the Python code wrapped in a markdown block (e.g., ```python ... ```)."""
